Hi ,this is a repository i created just to do some fun problems
in python, get a feel of it and find out what and how it is different
from the languages i previously knew. I hope python is as fun as 
most people say it is :).

There is no particular aim or problem set i would like to follow
at this point of time just get using , liking it and thinking in terms of it
